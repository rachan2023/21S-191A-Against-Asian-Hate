                What social problem is being addressed - 
                The local community or non-profit that is being empowered by your application?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The social problem that is being addressed is Asian American hate crimes,
                which spiked in our local communities during the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
                We want to evaluate and understand where hate crimes are persisting and isolate key trends that might shine more light on motives.

                What problems do you think may arise in developing this application (both technical and ethical)?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some technical problems that may arise when develping this 
                application are recognizing what data fits in the category of a hate crime, 
                creating a data visualization that accurately represents the data set, and making the application is accessible to everyone.

                Some ethical problems that may arise are finding ways to ensure that the application benefits 
                the community, highlights the communities' voices, and allows everyone's data to be included.
